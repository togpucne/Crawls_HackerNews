Becoming an authorized dealer is basically, fundamentally about building trust.  The whole coin industry operates in a very old-school relationship-based trusted way.  To become a member of most professional orgs or become an authorized dealer, you need to have 5-10 VERY solid references from other members or authorized dealers, and the only way to get those references is to be a part of the community, build trust, and build relationships by doing business with others (which means honoring your commitments and your word and writing good checks, etc.).

Configurable number of choices at the bottom of every chapter, and as you're reading, if the choice label doesn't link to a chapter yet, you can write it. It's been floating around since 1996 or so, so my big project lately has been upgrading it. v1 was perl and gdmb files. v2 was php and codeigniter, and it's been limping along there for several years. When ChatGPT came out, I rewrote the whole thing for scala/play and that was super fun. Moved from ubuntu14 to ubuntu20, mysql5.5 to 8.0, etc. I'm done with the rewrite now but am still messing around with launching it, upgrading to ubuntu22 (done today), figuring out if I want to update jvm/scala/play before launching, etc. All this for only a group of six writers (so far)! But collectively we've written more than 425 chapters across a handful of stories, 450,000 words, and had a lot of laughs.

Long latency between the control plane and workers affects workload reliability; heartbeats need to be configured with longer timeouts, for example. Pod-to-pod communication, where pods run in regions on opposite sides of the globe, supposedly on the same pod network CIDR, is also going to be flaky. There's a long history of projects attempting to take LAN-local designs and make them resistant to regional failure by superimposing a LAN on top of a WAN and it never works as intended. Furthermore, various service meshes already present ways of helping to direct/shape traffic between clusters (i.e. between regions), when service architecture evolves to truly support multiple regions.",reply?id=41345081&goto=item%3Fid%3D41342017%26p%3D4%2341345081,41345081,1 day ago,41344881

Then minimize the number of draw calls (that’s often what takes most time in the GPU) so I can render more varied graphics at the same speed (if less time is spent on sending data back and forth to the GPU, more time can be spent doing cool stuff in the shader code, I guess?).",reply?id=41347828&goto=item%3Fid%3D41342017%26p%3D2%2341347828,41347828,1 day ago,41347730

thiht,"I’m working on a test integration tool. You write your tests declaratively using YAML (ie. setup the environment, databases, etc., load fixtures, make api calls or db calls, and check assertions), so it’s completely language agnostic, which makes it perfect for grey-box/black-box testing. This way of testing also ensures you’re testing functional, business cases, and gives great stability on an exposed interface, because everything runs with real dbs, real queues and so on. From experience, this way of testing hits the perfect balance between reliability, usefulness, maintainability (when done right), and verbosity (at a previous company we replaced the tests on all of our layers with this kind of integration tests and it ended up being the most stable code base and test harness we ever worked on).",reply?id=41345913&goto=item%3Fid%3D41342017%26p%3D2%2341345913,41345913,1 day ago,41345730
